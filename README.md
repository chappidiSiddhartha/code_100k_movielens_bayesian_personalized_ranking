Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) Model for Implicit Feedback

Framework-
The implementation of the BPR model is provided by Cornac, a comprehensive framework for recommender systems that emphasizes models leveraging auxiliary data (e.g., item descriptions, images, and social networks). BPR is included in the model collections of Cornac.

For detailed documentation of the BPR model within Cornac, please refer to Cornac Documentation. The source code for the BPR implementation is available on the Cornac GitHub repository.

Data Splitting
To evaluate the performance of our item recommendation system, we utilize the python_random_split tool for consistency. The data is randomly divided into training and test sets with a 75/25 ratio.

Training the BPR Model
The BPR model has several important parameters that we need to consider:

k: Controls the dimension of the latent space (i.e., the size of the vectors).
max_iter: Defines the number of iterations for the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure.
learning_rate: Controls the step size in the gradient update rules.
lambda_reg: Controls the L2-regularization in the objective function.
Once the model is trained, we can generate ranked lists for recommendations. Each recommender model in Cornac provides the rate() and rank() methods for predicting item ratings and generating ranked lists for a given user.

Prediction and Evaluation
To utilize the current evaluation schemes, we will employ the predict() and predict_ranking() functions from the cornac_utils module to produce predictions.

Important Note
The BPR model is specifically designed for item ranking; therefore, we will measure performance using ranking metrics.
